# Activity Recognition based on objects detected

In this project, I use a dataset of features of objects detected in Activity Net's Exterior Maintenance Set of activities. The features are inferred using MRCNN e.g. confidence levels, bounding boxes, some feature of the masks. I use the dataset to train a standard LSTM model to classify the videos of the activities correctly. 

## Getting Started

You need to clone the reporistory to your local machine. Run this command in your terminal where you like to clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/melbrbry/Activity-Recognition
```

### Prerequisites
